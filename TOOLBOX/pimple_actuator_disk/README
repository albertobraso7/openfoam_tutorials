Simulation of a 2D Bluff Body in a High-Speed Wake in OpenFOAM  

All code can be found at:

DESCRIPTION:
In this tutorial we set a bluff body (high drag, low lift) into the high-speed 
wake of an actuator disk. We shall see that this causes the bluff body to 
become a more aerodynamic one.

OUTLINE:
-Generate mesh in Gmsh.
-Convert mesh to OpenFOAM format.
-Convert faceZone to wall baffle.
-Run the simulation.
