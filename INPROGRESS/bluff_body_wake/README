Simulation of a 2D Bluff Body in a High-Speed Wake in OpenFOAM  

All code can be found at: 
https://github.com/rlee32/openfoam_tutorials/tree/master/bluff_body_wake

DESCRIPTION:
In this tutorial we set a bluff body (high drag, no/low lift) into the 
high-speed wake of an actuator disk. We shall see that this causes the bluff 
body to become a more aerodynamic body.
Wake case average: <17.4, 8.6> N
No wake case average: <31, 14.5> N

OUTLINE:
-Generate mesh in Gmsh.
-Convert mesh to OpenFOAM format.
-Make internal baffle faces a pressure jump region.
-Run the simulation.

COMMANDS:
gmsh main.geo -3 -o test.msh
gmshToFoam test.msh -case case
# Now modify boundary file: 
#   -tunnel and body as walls
#   -front_and_back as empty
#   -baffle as cyclic
#   -add baffleother and neighbourPatch entries
createBaffles -case case -dict system/baffleDict -overwrite
