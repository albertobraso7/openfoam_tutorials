Structural Simulation in OpenFOAM: Cantilever Beam

All code can be found at: https://github.com/lordvon/OpenFOAM_Tutorials/tree/master/CantileverBeam

DESCRIPTION:
Here we will simulate a thin-walled square cantilever beam in OpenFOAM, using the solidDisplacementFoam solver. A mesh is made in Gmsh and pressure loads (AKA traction) are specified in the OpenFOAM case files.

OUTLINE:
-Go over mesh.
-Go over boundary conditions and load specification.
-Run the solver.

COMMANDS:
gmsh mesh/main.geo -3 -o test.msh
gmshToFoam test.msh -case case
# Modify boundary file.
solidDisplacementFoam
